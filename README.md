# Sat-Solver
A solution to the Satisfiablity problem.

Predicate.java contains the main method which asks the user to inpput values for clauses and how many literals each clause can have and then it checks if the formula is satisfiable.

Each clause should be satifiable for the formula to become satisfiable, If the formula detects falsehood, it backtracks to previous levels recursively to find the solution.

This Sat Solution can be scaled to 3-SAT , 4-SAT or any number(k-SAT).
